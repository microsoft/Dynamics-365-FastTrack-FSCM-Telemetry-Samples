# Dynamics-365-FastTrack-FSCM-Telemetry-Samples
Sample extensions for Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain Management to bootstrap teams wanting to start emitting telemetry for SCM related processes.

# Finance and Supply Chain Management Monitoring and Telemetry using Application Insights
The monitoring and telemetry feature in finance and operations apps is a direct, point-to-point integration between an instance of a 
finance and operations app and the target Application Insights destination. This feature lets developers and admins triage and resolve 
application issues in near-real time. The telemetry that's generated isn't collected by Microsoft for support or other operational reporting. 
Instead, the data is customer owned and customer driven.

Get started by following the documentation on MSLearn: [Monitoring and telemetry using Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/sysadmin/monitoring-and-telemetry-appinsights)

For specific guidelines on Warehouse Management telemetry, documentation can be found on MSLearn:
